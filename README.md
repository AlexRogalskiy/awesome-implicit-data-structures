# Implicit data structures

## Sorted list

## Binary heap

## Min-max heap

## Binomial list (Bentley-Saxe)

Doesn't support deletes natively, uses "soft deletes" (marking an element
as deleted).

## Beap (Bi-parental heap)

## Rotated sorted lists


# Succint data structures

## Red-black trees

When storing just left/right node pointers, algorithms exist for one-pass
top-down insertion and deletion. (For comparison, for AVL trees, only
insertion top-down algorithm exists, deletion requires 2-pass algorithm).
